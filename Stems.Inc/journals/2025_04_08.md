- Reflect of the day:
	- **Did I follow through on the actions I committed to today? If not, what stopped me — distraction, doubt, or lack of clarity?**
		- Completed stuff is Reflect in DSA and committed to 4 things.
		- Not Block the time, except the DSA session. it is worked for that.
	- **How strongly did I stay connected to my intention and why behind the task? Did I show up fully, even when it was hard?**
	- **What would it look like if I brought 10% more focus or courage tomorrow — and what's one small change I can make to get there?**
