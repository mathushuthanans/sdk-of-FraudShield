- [[DATA]] - Variation
	- Primitive values which cast to extend it's range & size
	- Objects are created in Heap memory and variation through the definition of structure (State & behaviour of a Class)
	- Static - Variable (common to all), methods (can use without init), block (execute only one and common to all)
- Abstract and [[Interface]] - Generalizing the Class
	- Can't create any instance, but created for one time execution through anonymous class.
	- Types of Interface: Normal, Function (only one method), marker (no method & use to store in hard disks)
	- The methods are public and the Variables are final and static
- Exceptions
	- runtime errors - Exceptions. Finally is used to close the resources or must need execution
	- throw - new Exception thrown.
- [[Threads]] - maintain the data integrity while sharing and accessing at the same time.
	- Extends threads - Just use the `object.start()`
	- Implement runnable (imp many things) - create object, pass the object to thread object, then `threadObject.start()`
	- (2 or more) Threads Is Sharing same resources -`synchronized`  the method/block/using wait, notify, which locks and performs. `join()` is use to perform all the operations completed.
- [[Collection API]]

	- List, Set, Map, Queue - Data structure that is build-in.
	- Streams, The operation is performed for every elements by once on Collections.
	- Lambda expressions and method references used.
	- Parallel streams are threaded stream.
- Maven - [[Jan 21st, 2025]]
	- Standard file structures for collaboration
	- all phases are maintain to work with single commands
	- manual works on library are automated
- Install Maven to VS Code
	- Install the extensions
	- mvn repo -> copy the dependency "GAV"
	- Execution Path to set : `/home/mathushuthanans/Documents/DemoWorkout/sampleprojects/pom.xml` No this is not in the case create a new one.
	- see if Maven central in the catalogue
	- change the version of java to 23 in pom.xml file.
- [[Java Database Connectivity]] - [[Jan 22nd, 2025]]
	- Using PostgreSQL.
	- [[PostgreSQL setup]] and procedures:
		- download the library driver and get it to [[external libraries]]
		- for Maven, get to mvn repo. get the dependency link and paste & reload to pom.xml -- [[PostgreSQL with maven]]
	- ==**Steps to Connect  Java and Database**== - [[Code for Connection b/w Java and Database and CRUD Operations]] & [[JDBC & SQL common Queries]]
		- import packages: `java.sql`;
		- Load and register driver (optional)
		- Create Connection between **Java and Database**
		- Create and Execute Statement, process and close the connection.
- Basic `sql` Queries
	- ```
	  SELECT "username", COUNT(*) AS "user_count"
	  FROM "UserData"
	  GROUP BY "username"
	  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
	  ORDER BY "user_count" DESC;
	  ```
- [[Hibernate]] - [[Java Database Connectivity]] [[ORM]]
	- Session is opened to save data through config the DB, opening the factory and begin the Transaction
	- `hibernate.cfg.xml` Config file and definition
		- ```java
		  <hibernate-configuration xmlns="http://www.hibernate.org/xsd/orm/cfg">
		  <session-factory>
		      <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.postgresql.Driver</property>

- [[Spring]] and [[Spring Boot]] - [[Jan 23rd, 2025]] - Big enterprise application - POJO and is an ecosystem.
	- ==The Objects are created and managed by the framework== as Beans all at once and stored in a **IoC container**. Whenever you need the object, you just inject it from the container, *directly get the Bean (or) Autowired/linked.* This approach allows developers to focus on business logic and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies.

- Object in Spring -  [[Annotations]] , [[xml config]] , [[Java-based Config]]
	- The programmer does not directly create an object, *==but describes how it  should be created, by defining it in the Spring configuration file==*.
	- The Steps for Object creation
		- Creating Containers to  hold the objects
		- Define the Configuration File
		- Config the Object
		- Inject the Objects
		- Define the Scope.
- [[Scope]] & [[Interface]]
	- Singleton - *creates only one object, GLOBAL to the app & maintained*
	- prototype - *everytime new object created whenever called*
	- Lazy-init - *Created the object after it's first call in the container.*
	- Primary bean - *primary bean for a Interface* and it is Default
	- Qualifiers - Explicitly defining the Choice.
- [[Dependency Injection]]
	- inject values and object through xml file. config the properties and initial values.
	- Setter injection - `<properties/>`:  for values and refs, inject through setters
	- Constructor Injection - `<constructor-args/>`: for values and refs in sequences.
- Spring JDBC - [[Java Database Connectivity]]
	- Import the JBDC template from`org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate`
	- Query and update(Query, Object[] args)
	- [[Spring Boot]] Based
		- ```java
		  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/telusko
		  spring.datasource.username=postgres
		  spring.datasource.password=Lumia@540
		  spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
		  
		  ```
	- [[Java-based Config]]
		- ```java
		      // DataSource bean
		      @Bean
		      public DataSource dataSource() {
		          DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
		          dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost/m2302");
		          dataSource.setUsername("postgres");
		          dataSource.setPassword("google.com12345");
		          return dataSource;
		      }
		  
		      @Bean
		      public JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate(){
		          JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate();
		          jdbcTemplate.setDataSource(dataSource());
		          return jdbcTemplate;
		      }
		  
		      @Bean
		      public JDBC jdbcClass(){
		          JDBC jdbcClass = new JDBC();
		          jdbcClass.setJdbc(jdbcTemplate());
		          return jdbcClass;
		      }
		  ```
- Spring Web and MVC - to build web applications - here is the basic hosting of server [[Basic hosting of a server]]
	- Request is being sent to the server through the web browser. The Server which hosts the application, send them to it. The Controller/Front Controller which consist of `url tags` mapped with the corresponding pages and the Matched segment is being executed. (It Might be a Controller, Service, Repo, or views).
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1739555488702_0.png)

	- ### Servelets
		- Servlets are the class accept the request and do task return the response. Is the Component of the server.  the big picture of them are controller
		- Question I asked: How can I run the backend Programs without a server or Virtual Machines/ Webservices? #card

			- The Projects/application is run through creating packages of them into .war and using the embedded tomcat to run the project locally.
		- 2 dependencies are needed `Jarakarta servlet` and `Tomcat embed core`
	-
	- ### Practice of Spring MVC and Spring Boot Web configs
		- Spring boot takes over all the actions. The Configuration of Controller is required.
		- `RequestParam` is used to handle difference in Parameter and the `url` idNames.
		- Model - the way represent data (Organization and Logical Manipulation) and **pass data from the controller to the view**
			- [[Fixing JSTL Not Working in Spring Boot 3+ (JSP Pages)]]
			- Model in this context, to Hold the data consistently for Multiple Pages.
		- View - the front end data and format, presenting the data to the user.
		- Control - Handles the process (Controller, Service and Repository) in terms of flow of the application, interacting with the Model and selecting the appropriate View.
		- `@ModelAttribute` -  is used to *bind Form/`url` Data into Objects*. In the parameter, (it is optional while having same parameter name to mention) Convert the Values from the URL tag to an Object. And so the Method **Is to READ**
			- ```java
			  @ModelAttribute
			  public String course(){
			    return "Java";
			  }
			  -------------------------------
			  // in jsp
			    <h1> Welcome to ${course}</h1>
			  ```
		- `modelandview` - to handle/set data and return the view page.
	-
	- ### Configs in Spring Web
		- *The Location to Scan and Way of the Configuration* is method in the`web.xml`, (Front Controller) and handles the rest of the Flow automatically.
		- ```java
		  // the web.xml
		  
		  <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
		   "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"

	- ### `@ResponseBody`
		- Return the Object rather the Views (which is default of the controller)
		- The `@RestController` is the Controller of all ResponseBody
		-
	- ### `@RequestBody`
		- `@RequestBody` in the Parameter to indicate (to get the JSON format to Object)
		- the `@pathVariable` is used to get the values.
