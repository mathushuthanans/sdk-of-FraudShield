		  “See it. Control it. Trust it.”
		  
		  
		  A platform to make **data transparency simple**,
		  giving users control over what’s collected, shared, and permitted—
		  and helping developers stay privacy-compliant effortlessly.

		- Digital Trust Without Digital Clutter
		- Online users frequently share personal data across apps, sites,
		  and services without knowing how it's stored, shared, or used.
		  Most don’t read privacy policies or understand consent
		  frameworks. Meanwhile, developers build authentication
		  systems, yet ignore transparency or user control. Developers
		  focus on login systems but overlook transparency and user
		  autonomy. What kind of solution can empower users to take
		  control of their digital identity and data relationships, while
		  being easy for developers to integrate? You might build a
		  digital-passport, or an extension, or a dashboard, or maybe a
		  plug-and-play API! The innovation is yours…
	- Page 3: Solution overview
		- **The Proposed Idea**:
			- ## Transparency Summary on Sign-in Page.
				- A summary screen that shows users what data is collected, where it goes, and what they can control
					- **Collected**: Lists user data like email, location, device info
					- **Shared**: Shows third parties receiving data (e.g., analytics, ad networks)
					- **Controlled**: Displays permissions granted and lets users manage them
			- ## Data Passport: Privacy Dashboard
			  id:: 6831c39a-f4b0-49d2-9781-5ea4f02e6f78
				- A unified dashboard showing per-app data usage, consents, and sharing history
					- Shows all apps with their granted permissions and data policies.
					- Lets users manage all permissions and agreements from one place, with instant policy updates.
					- Monitors real-time data sharing by SDKs using proxy tools and alerts users automatically.
			- ## Privacy API & SDK for Developers
				- A ready-to-use SDK with annotations and API endpoints for logging data usage and managing permissions
					- **Starter Dependency**: Quick-Integrate Privacy Controls
					- **Privacy Annotations**: Auto-Log Data Usage & Permissions
					- **API Endpoints**: Manage User Consents & Access Logs

		- **Flutter** - Frontend framework with Dio for HTTP and Riverpod for state management
		- **Spring Boot** - Backend services with Spring Security for authentication
		- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for user preferences and consent policies
		- **Kafka** - Real-time data streaming and event processing
		- **Redis** - Caching layer for dynamic configuration templates
		- **MongoDB** - Audit logging and long-term data storage
		- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** - Push notifications for alerts
		- **Docker & Kubernetes** - Containerization and orchestration

		- Sign-In Transparency
			- **Dynamic Config:** JSON templates (editable by admins) define what data is shown as collected/shared during login. Cached in Redis for speed.
			- **Permission Control:** Secure endpoints (`/toggle/{permission}`) update user preferences in PostgreSQL.
			- **Frontend:** Built in Flutter using Dio (for HTTP) + JWT auth + Riverpod for managing state securely.
		- Data Passport Dashboard**
			- **Consent Engine:** Policies are versioned in PostgreSQL. When changed, users are prompted to re-consent.
			- **Real-Time Monitoring:** SDK data is streamed via Kafka, analyzed by Spring AI, and pushed via WebSockets to the user.
			- **Alerts & Logs:** FCM notifies users of sensitive events. MongoDB stores audit logs for 6 months.
		- Developer Privacy SDK**
			- **Auto-Logging:** Use `@DataUsage` annotations (AspectJ) to auto-log data access, pushed to Kafka.
			- **Consent Gateway:** API traffic goes through Spring Cloud Gateway with built-in rate-limiting (Resilience4J).
			- **Flutter Plugin:** Pre-built Dio interceptors and BLoC components handle policy sync and permission prompts.

		- This platform makes digital privacy actionable — giving users full visibility and control over what data they share and with whom. Backed by a developer-friendly SDK and real-time tracking, it offers a feasible and scalable path to rebuild trust in a cluttered digital world.
			- #### Technical Feasibility
				- **Platform**: Flutter (cross-platform UI), Spring Boot (backend) – scalable, modern tech stack.
				- **SDK Integration**: Custom SDK logs sensitive data access (camera, location, etc.) with minimal developer effort via annotations/hooks.
				- **Monitoring**: Real-time data flow tracking feasible via SDK logging. Proxy/VPN-based monitoring is technically intensive & limited.
				- **Scalability**: Requires secure, encrypted event storage with support for high-volume user logs.
			- #### Operational Feasibility
				- **User Experience**: Central dashboard for viewing apps, shared data, permissions, with toggle controls – intuitive and aligned with Android privacy dashboards.
				- **Developer Adoption**: Success depends on ease of SDK use and regulatory pressure. Lightweight SDK and documentation are key.
				- **Maintenance**: Continuous updates required to support OS versions, SDK upgrades, and secure log handling.
			- #### Legal Feasibility
				- **GDPR/CCPA Compliant**: Aligns with user rights – access, revoke, delete, and audit data.
				- **Consent Tracking**: SDK logs act as verifiable consent records.
				- **Data Protection**: Encryption, user authentication, and audit trails ensure platform trust and security.
