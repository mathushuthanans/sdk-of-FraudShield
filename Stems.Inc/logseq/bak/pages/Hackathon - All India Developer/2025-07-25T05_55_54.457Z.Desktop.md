- Why should the Idea is Workable:
  collapsed:: true
	- Most bot detection focuses on:
	- **Before login** (reCAPTCHA, rate limiting, IP blocks)
	- **Login abuse** (credential stuffing, brute force)
	  
	  But **post-login bot detection** is:
	- **Rare** but **critical**: because **many bots succeed at login** using stolen credentials (from breaches, phishing, etc).
	- These bots then:
		- Scrape data
		- Perform fraud (banking, offers)
		- Abuse API endpoints (cart abuse, ticket scalping)
		- Exfiltrate user/business data
		  
		  Your system addresses this exact risk — **active bot behavior after login**.

- Why does this idea, not been implemented??
  collapsed:: true
	- Your idea — detecting bots *after login* based on user behavior — is **valuable and rare**, but:
		- **Most systems wrongly trust users after login**, so they skip checks.
		- **It's hard to build** (behavior tracking, real-time analysis, no false blocks).
		- **Privacy concerns** make devs cautious.
		- **Most bot protection tools only guard login**, not what happens after.
		- **You're early** — but this is where things are heading (zero-trust, continuous validation).
- **Behavioral anomalies**
	- Human users have **imperfect timing**, natural jitter.
	- Bots have:
		- Precise cursor jumps
		- Perfect typing speed
		- Zero hesitation
		- No idle time
		- Tab-switch/scroll patterns that look robotic
	- #### 2.  **Session rhythm**
		- A user browsing casually vs. bot clicking 30 pages in 5 seconds = red flag
	- #### 3.  **Device + fingerprint mismatch**
		- Logged in from a browser → suddenly acts like a headless script? Block.
	- #### 4.  **Invisible traps**
		- Place hidden buttons/fields. Bots might click them, users won’t.
	- #### 5.  **Challenge-response**
		- Micro challenges like “shake mouse” or random delay input — users can do, bots fail.
