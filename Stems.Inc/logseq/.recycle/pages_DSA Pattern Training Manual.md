  You donâ€™t learn DSA by watching or reading. You learn it by **failing to code it, figuring it out,** and then locking it in with variants.

- key thing: **Try a Problem with 30 - 40 minutes max.**
-
-
- ## Learn the Patterns
- **Always try yourself.** (any brute force, optimised or stupid solution) -- **Just for 25 to 30 minutes**. Even pseudo code is fine.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Look up for others' Solution and see Where and Why did they shine/structure/done the logic. --> Record in DS notebook
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Understand the pattern. (Note: **My logic** vs. **Pattern's requirement**)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Rewrite pseudocode from your understanding
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Then code it again **yourself without copy-paste**. Maintain in the DS Notebook.

- **Try out yourself, -- Aim for 80%** & Log what line you got stuck there.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- **Pick 1 - 2 Similar Ideas** and try it out. If persist:
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Reduce the problem into 2 to 3 elements - try to understand the flow.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- My logic vs. Pattern's requirement - mini debugging 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Compare side-by-side working ideal with your work
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Re-try with a tracker. try to solve from scratch only from the Notes.
