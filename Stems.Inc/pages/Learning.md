- ## Real Work. Real Learning
- **Focus on Building solutions for Real Problems** rather chasing learning alone (or) shining topics.
- **Decompose that problem on achievable manner to that day. Outline the Project.**
	- Resultant small tasks + determination.
	- Focus on easy first and Bigger Picture.
- **While learning new Unknown stuff**
	- Do your *own research/priming.
	- send at least 20 - 30 days coding things myself: (learning by read docs, basic tutorial and  implement small thing by myself then use it directly to the project).
	- Get why and How things happen, it's limitations, & Use cases while learning.
- Then use AI to complete and validate the programs.

- ## Schema: The process of Learning
- **Schema: Turning the Right Information --> Practical Knowledge**
	- **Schema Construction:**Big Picture/ Context to Draft organization
		- Synthopical Reading - *Collect the resources to a single page, Organize the topics/Titile sense to me from those resources and get through*
		- Start with the relevancy - *Where you feel know or done.*
		- Guess and Question - *go thro the topics and how much they connect to the Big Picture*
	- **Schema Assimilation:** - Absorb and Fit the Information
		- Order Control - Read the Material and Absorb, what they are talking on. #permanent-notes -  *it Simple and Layer on it, complete the relevant details and then re-read again*
	- **Schema Re-organization** - Grouping your Patterns
		- Do-it Often
		- Just Do it.
		- > Higher Ordering
		  Try to relate information to each other and to the Bigger Picture. Consume a Lil bit of information and ask Questions like, how does this relate to what I just learnt and how does it relate to the Bigger picture. And **Cognitive Tolerance**

- ## DSA Pattern Manual Training
  id:: 682400ec-704d-4baa-bfca-53bf252226ff
	- Focus on  Reflection (**deliberate practice**, **varying context**, **reflecting regularly**, and **spaced recall)**
	  
	  >  You don’t learn DSA by watching or reading. You learn it by **failing to code it, figuring it out,** and then locking it in with variants.
	- key thing: **Try a Problem with 30 - 40 minutes max.**
	- ### Learn the Patterns - Varying Context
	- **Always try yourself.** (any brute force, optimised or stupid solution) -- **Just for 25 to 30 minutes**. Even pseudo code is fine.
	- Look up for others' Solution and see Where and Why did they shine/structure/done the logic. --> Record in DS notebook
		- Understand the pattern. (Note: **My logic** vs. **Pattern's requirement**)
		- Rewrite pseudocode from your understanding
		- Then code it again **yourself without copy-paste**. Maintain in the DS Notebook.
	- **Try out yourself, -- Aim for 80%** & Log what line you got stuck there.
	- **Pick 1 - 2 Similar Ideas** and try it out. If persist:
		- Reduce the problem into 2 to 3 elements - try to understand the flow.
		- My logic vs. Pattern's requirement - mini debugging
		- Compare side-by-side working ideal with your work
	- Re-try with a tracker. try to solve from scratch only from the Notes.

- ## My Style | Learning concept - Deliberate Learning and Practice
- The topic I want to Learn -- a basic tutorial video/doc.
- Basic Theory in **My own patterns & Groups**
- Very Basic Problems
- Easy Problems with 30 minutes - pseudo code then implement it
- If stuck,
	- Write where I'm stuck in my pseudo code,
	- Trace the input and my solution and ask every "**why does it**" question
- Repeat the similar concept questions to solve.
	- Try pseudo code, implement, note the stuck, trace the solution and ask every doubt.
- **Repeat-Repeat-Repeat**.
