- A Strong why -- that results to do the Actions & move my ass towards my Goal.
- The Actions are the strong motivator, and Just doing actions (without any damn thoughts)
-
- How to regain the **High value Context & Why**
	- Define the visions, purpose, -> the positive way of end result, roadmap for direction + importantly define the anti-vision
	- Track the consistency on the Actions as well as the reminding part of **the Anti-vision and the positive way of the end result.**
	- Just do the Actions regardless of How you're feeling. Act first, think later. Set a rule: when the task pops up, start within 5 seconds. Like your hackathon grind—no overthinking, just doing.
	- Make it ugly and real. Write the worst-case scenario: “I’m 40, broke, and regret everything.” Read it when you’re tempted to skip. Fear’s a hell of a motivator.
	- Internal Conditioning
	-
- **How does it breaks**
	- The inconsistency in actions (like missing days for the actions or procrastinate for long run)
	- The state of mind changes to other state - which is inconsistent actions & forgetting the anti-visions' consequences
	- expecting the results immediately, the directionless after a milestone,
	- **reminding part is vanished in the why through inconsistency**. Shiny Object Syndrome or the environment that I switched.
	- The Actions are broke through the racing thoughts, second thought, thoughts on other's opinion. And does not Reflect on the Visions, purpose or providing any time for "the positive consequences of the actions".

- **Evidence for "why" driven actions and achievements**
	- hack-a-thon @ NIT trichy
	- The thought of Being the superior
	- the fasting during 3rd semester
	-
- **Where does the Why comes from**
	- ==_Anti - vision_== - a factor which I supposed to not would be in that Way.
	- ==_The Positive Way of Final Result & the Feel of Achieving_== - the real drive for the **High - value context**
	- evidence:
		- Hack-a-thon @ NIT trichy - *If I slept & didn't done any actions on the project, there is nothing to show while presenting and I can't betray my team.*
		- The thought of being the superior - *I don't wanna be an-average-settled-person, I'm destined to be a Shining Star.*
		- the fasting - *I wanna be toned, conscious on my gut and channelize my energy. *
